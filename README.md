Cru Baseplate
=============

Cru Baseplate is the default starting point for front-end builds.

DO NOT MAKE CHANGE TO INUIT.CSS or CRUBRAND.CSS. These are purely frameworks for you to build on top of. 

Changing these will mess up your project since they are being run as submodules and therefore do not technically exist in your fork. Instead fork the projects themselves and make a direct pull request.
